Builder New Vegas


Builder new vegas is a platform to create and browse character builds for the video game Fallout: New Vegas.


The site contains a pagiented list of posts from authenticated users. A post may be selected to view its detailed view and see all information. Site viewers may register an account to access build creation features.
Site admins may use the django admin panel to approve, delete, and create posts. Authenticated users can create posts using the form provided in the website.

The website was built using HTML, CSS, Python(Django), Cloudinary, Bootstrap, Crispyforms, and Summernote.

There's so much that didn't make it in, a decent readme files is one of them.
Code to work out if the special stats meet the 40 points allocated. Code to make sure 3 tagged skills are always selected. Code to ensure you couldn't select more than 2 traits. Code to provide helper text for the various form entry points. Pop-up cards to provide additional information for specific parts of the build detailed view.

I'd do it that I didn't have to fight with the deployed version failing to show the css styling. The flood of the same commit is just me trying to get the stylesheet to work in heroku. I FINALLY GOT IT WORKING!!!

Testing... well I tried.

The html and css got through validators... just.

The python went through Pep8, line length came up but I couldn't get the changes to work so Pep8 just had to complain.

I'm in agony finishing this project. I've let down myself and the whole system. I'm sorry that this is such a poor show for a project.

Please be kind, I have really tried to make a site that works. The documentation, the commenting, the testing... I've done a terrible job.

Thank you for looking. I am sorry.
